Communication Patterns\n\n62% of messages were received by Nadia, with the rest sent—suggesting her central but reactive role.\nTemporal concentration: High frequency around Oct 8–9, notably around 8–11 AM, correlates with coordination hours for logistics and surveillance.\n\n2. Message Timeline by Event Type\n\nNadia’s messages largely relate to Permits, followed by Construction and Patrol — domains critical to legitimizing and shielding site activities.\nSpike in Permit + Construction messages on Oct 8 aligns with surveillance and vessel movement around Nemo Reef.\n\n3. Keyword Analysis (Oct 8)\n\nFrequent terms: \"equipment\", \"foundation\", \"payment\", \"modified\", \"meeting\", \"document\", \"marina\".\nSuggestive of covert preparation: approvals, underwater foundation work, coordination, and movement.\n\n4. Network Analysis\n\nNadia is the central hub, receiving and sending messages to key players (Neptune, Elise, Davis, Miesel Shipping).\nDirectionality shows she’s not just a participant but the orchestrator, funneling information between entities.\n\n5. Timeline of External Evidence\n\nOct 5–9: Several independent surveillance reports and assessments verify:\nMako’s suspicious proximity\nUnauthorized underwater construction\nRedirected patrol schedules\nElise & Nadia exchanges confirming documentation and coordination\n\n\n\nYes. Strongly.\n\nThe alignment between Nadia’s peaks in communication, permit-handling, and confirmed movement/construction at Nemo Reef (despite her claiming cancellation) supports Clepper’s suspicion.\nEven without direct messages showing illicit orders, visual analytics indicate:\n\nNadia controlled logistics, timelines, and access\nDelegated riskier operations (e.g., payment, surveillance diversion) to others\nObfuscated true operations under legal cover (permits)",

Fields like reference, authority_level, and report_type are nearly all NA.\nFields like monitoring_type, assessment_type, movement_type, etc. also show very sparse use. Which supports the earlier glimpse() finding where most attribute fields are only relevant to certain subtypes (e.g. type = “events” and sub_type = “Communications” will have timestamp and content but other type and sub_types doesn’t have these information).

But as we’ve discovered from the earlier findings in earlier SmartEDA of nodes_tbl and glimpse(), we know that only certain type and sub_type have all information.\nSignificant portion of edges are evidence_for (32%), suggests more evidential or contextual links. Possibly connecting events or documents to people, vessels, or actions.\nCommunication events (e.g., who sent/received messages) only make up 18% each of the dataset means that communication-specific analyses should filter only these types, excluding NA and evidence_for.\nThese observations support the earlier suggestion in glimpse() to filter only communication related data for our visualisation later on.",

Are you available tomorrow afternoon?\n\n\nEvent_Communication_7\n2040-10-01 08:21:00\nMrs. Money, this is Boss. I’m available tomorrow at 3 PM to discuss funding allocations.

Focuses on visual exploration of the intercepted communication metadata. The app will be divided into 4 main section that will be further detailed in Chapter 4. It will be focusing on:\n\nIdentifying temporal patterns in communications.\nRevealing relationships and influence among entities (people, vessels, groups).\n\n\n\n2 Communication Clusters and Pseudonyms\nThe second app, Communication Clusters and Pseudonyms, will be based on Part 2 - Communication Cluster and Pseudonym: Hoa’s Take Home Exercise 2. It aims to deepen the analysis of communication networks by identifying patterns of association and hidden identities through an interactive platform for revealing the structure and semantics behind the communication web. It will be focusing on:\n\nUncovering interactions and relationships between vessels and individuals in the network.\nIdentifying tightly knit groups and inferring the dominant topics of their discussions.\nDetecting the use of pseudonyms and linking them back to real identities.\nExploring how visual analytics can help expose common identities disguised under multiple aliases.\n\n\n\n3 Time Series Analysis and Social Network Graph\nThe third app, Time Series Analysis and Social Network Graph, will be based on Part 3 - Time Series Analysis and Social Network graph: Summer’s Take Home Exercise 2. It is centered around Clepper’s primary concern—whether Nadia Conti remains involved in illegal activity. It will be focusing on:\n\nDetermining whether Nadia Conti is currently engaging in any unlawful behavior based on communication patterns and interactions.\nSummarizing her activities over time through temporal and network-based visualizations to support or refute Clepper’s suspicions.\n\nThis app combines time series trends and social network dynamics to track Nadia’s role and influence within the broader network.",

    "text": "This project is developed as part of the VAST Mini Challenge 2025. The chosen topic is Mini-Challenge 3, which focuses on the investigation of rising tensions and suspicious activities in Oceanus—an island community undergoing economic and regulatory transformations. Following crackdowns on illegal fishing, many suspects are believed to have redirected their interests into the tourism sector, potentially exploiting it for hidden agendas.\nLed by investigative journalist Clepper Jessen, the case revolves around intercepted radio communications tied to the temporary closure of Nemo Reef. These communications hint at expedited approvals, pseudonyms, and covert logistics involving public officials, influential families, and celebrities such as Sailor Shift. Our task is to apply novel visual analytics approaches to decode patterns, relationships, and suspicious behaviors hidden in these interactions to help uncover the truth behind Oceanus’s unfolding story.",
